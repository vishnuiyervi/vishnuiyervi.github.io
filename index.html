                I am a second-year PhD student at UT Austin, where I am advised by <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/">Scott Aaronson</a> and supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. My research interests are in complexity theory and quantum information (please see the <a href="#research">research</a> section for more details). Previously, I was an undergraduate studying EECS at UC Berkeley, where I was incredibly fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://avishaytal.org">Avishay Tal</a> and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prasad/">Prasad Raghavendra</a>.
                <br> <br>
                I am also keenly interested in teaching computer science. At UC Berkeley, I served as a teaching assistant five times and plan to continue improving as a teacher throughout my academic career. For more information, please visit the <a href="#teaching">teaching</a> section of this page.
                <br> <br>
                Outside of my academics, I am interested in nature, tennis, basketball, and gaming. I am also very passionate about civil rights and environmental issues. During my free time, you can find me playing pickup basketball/tennis, playing Minecraft and Pokemon, and cheering on Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors.

            <h3 id = "research">Research Overview</h3>
            Broadly speaking, I am interested in the intersection betwen classical notions of computational complexity and quantum phenomena. For example, what implications do results in physics have on complexity theory (and vice versa), and how can canonical techniques in one area be used to show results in the other?
            More concretely, some research directions I focus on (or plan to focus on in the near future) include:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Constrained Quantum Computing Models: there are some models of quantum computing (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_gates">Clifford circuits</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product_state">matrix product states</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003137">fermionic quantum computation</a> that can be simulated efficiently with classical computers: they can also serve to characterize more complex quantum systems (e.g. via stabilizer rank). Can we understand those more complex systems by breaking them down into these simpler components?</li>
                <li><a href = "https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2018/10993397/10993397.pdf">Quantum Pseudorandomness</a>: what is the complexity of constructing quantum states that look random?</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_model">Query Complexity</a>: what are the optimal separations we can get between quantum query models and other complexity measures?</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_complexity">Circuit Complexity</a>: what lower bounds can we prove on the complexity of quantum circuits?</li>
            </ul>

            In 2019, I received the Oustanding GSI award from the UC Berkeley Graduate Division, for which I am incredibly grateful to my students and mentors. My full evaluations at UC Berkeley can be found <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/instructor/Iyer,Vishnu">here</a>.

            <h3 id = "service">Service</h3>
            I believe it is very important for academics to impact their environments through service. As an undergraduate, I served on the EECS Undergraduate Study Committee (UGSC), interfacing with professors to address issues such as elitism and discrimination. In addition, I worked with the department to design, administer, and analyze the annual undergraduate experience survey. My peers and I presented the results of this to members of the faculty, which led to a number of changes, including the EE/CS community week and calls for culture change within EECS extracurricular groups.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Fall 2022, I was a volunteer with <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/texasprisoneducation/">Texas Prison Education Initiative</a>, where I taught UT Austin's introductory mathematics course to inmates.
